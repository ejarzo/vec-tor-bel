*False Flag is proud to present Vec Tor Bel from NonCoreProjector—a collective formed by
Rollo Carpenter, Jack Colton, Elias Jarzombek, and John O’Connor.*

*Projected onto the gallery’s main wall is a continually-evolving series of translucent videos,
overlaid with dynamic colored graphs. The visual content is produced by Cleverbot, a chatbot
developed by Rollo Carpenter, driven by an artificial intelligence algorithm. Each day initiates a new
conversation: Cleverbot pulls a headline from the morning’s news, searches that phrase on
YouTube, plays the resulting video, and reads aloud the first comment - which becomes the initial
node on a projected graph. Cleverbot responds to this initial comment, then uses the response for a
subsequent search, repeating this cycle through the end of the day.*
